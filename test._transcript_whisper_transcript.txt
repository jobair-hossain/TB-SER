I'm hosting a karaoke party on Sunday. Wow! You are quite the party animal, aren't you? That's nothing. You should have seen me in college. A party animal is not an actual animal. It is a person who really enjoys going to parties. Most of their time is spent finding out where the latest and best party is going to be. And that's English in a Minute.
