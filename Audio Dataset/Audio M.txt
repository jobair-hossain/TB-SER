Welcome to the Opa Academy, Leonard.

This is Mr. Ellis, sixth grade science class.

Final minute, Sienna.

Make sure you have something written in the left column and in the middle column.

Yeah, Jose.

We should talk about that.

Three, two, one.

Hands down, one minute.

Sixty, fifty-nine, fifty-eight, fifty-seven.

Now ladies, keep working on your do now or dear.

Fifty seconds.

Nilsen's found lesson twelve.

Jose is getting organized.

Merit Carlos done endearing.

Thirty seconds.

Merit Nileshka, thank you for being responsible with that.

You've got twenty seconds.

Anderson is done endearing.

Omiel, merit for remembering.

You can go get it.

I got it for you, Omiel.

Who can read number one?

Anderson.

Power merit Nileshka.

Power merit Darwin.

Wilbur for the class.

Sienna snap it up for starting with our power merits.

Welcome to unit three on engineering.

I know we've been, this is actually day one and I don't know what you know from fifth

grade.

So I just want two answers from the first box and two from the second box.

What do you know about engineering?

Hands down, track Jose Mateo and Shine.

Merit Jose for the agreement signal and merit Jose for the good start.

Track Edgar, what do you know?

But you have to be careful hands down.

If you track the middle picture or me, sometimes people think it's just motors.

Engineers might also design medicines.

Engineers might also design replacement limbs for people who lose them during wars.

Engineers don't just make machines.

What do you want to know about engineering?

What do you want to know?

Hands down, track Jose Francis, shining.

Power.

And you won't get that this unit, but we'll talk about that later this year.

And hands down, track Jalen, what do you want to know?

They almost always build things.

Sometimes though they might design things.

They might not be building things every day.

Tracking up here.

So far this year we've just been talking about science.

Science is all about discovering new knowledge so we understand the universe.

And they might say, oh man, I just discovered this new galaxy super far away.

One loose to America, get your hand down.

They might say, oh man, I just discovered how particles work.

But engineering is all about using the knowledge to design solutions and

solve problems.

So if scientists say, oh man, here's the galaxy.

Engineers would say, sweet, how do we solve the problem of?

I need to discover it and it's really far away.

I have to invent a space shuttle.

Engineers are using the knowledge scientists find to design solutions to problems.

So here is your first problem you need to solve during this unit.

With power, Frandy.

Engineers will be able to build and

index cards towards the space in the right.

Yep, repeat after me, Frandy.

Tower.

Tower to the space.

Glenn.

Repeat after me, Hedgehog.

Hedgehog.

Hedgehog.

Track me.

This is Glenn, the Hedgehog.

Everyone say, hi Glenn.

Hi Glenn.

So you guys might not know this, but I actually, I don't have a dog and

I don't have a cat, I have a hedgehog.

This is my hedgehog.

Her name is Eleanor and she is the best hedgehog ever.

Snap it up for Eleanor the Hedgehog.

This is not a joke.

This is legitimately my hedgehog.

And because someone didn't believe me, I took a picture last night with

Eleanor on my shoulder.

She really likes to crawl and like hide, but

she couldn't find a place to hide, so I took a good picture.

This is Eleanor, and Eleanor is very important.

This is Glenn, who is her slightly less alive cousin.

This is a hedgehog.

Everyone say, hi hedgehogs.

Hi hedgehogs.

Hedgehogs are great.

They're normally really spiky, but this one is not.

Now here's the problem.

Hedgehogs are important.

Ladies, can you see Glenn the hedgehog?

No, not really.

I wanna make, hands down, a tower.

Tall enough that I can see Glenn the hedgehog, because the problem is,

I wanna see Glenn.

Glenn is really important to me, but I can't see Glenn.

Glenn is on the floor.

Who can tell me what's the problem I need to solve today?

Hands down, track Wilbur and Shine.

And the problem you need to solve today is that you want to see hedgehog in the tower.

Turn the page.

At the top of page two, stop and jot.

You have one minute.

What is the problem we need to solve today?

What is the problem I need to solve today?

And Merritt Edgar started right away.

Juan Luis is writing.

Aladis is writing.

What is the problem I need to solve today?

Top of page two.

Mm-hm, top of page two.

What is the problem we need to solve?

Angel's writing.

Nelashka's writing.

Smart hand, Merritt DeCarlos.

I do write hedgehog.

You write hedgehog?

In case you're looking for some spelling help.

H-E-D-G-E-H-O-G.

When you are done, show me a thumb.

You have 30 seconds.

Aladis, posture, Merritt.

Edgar looks ready.

Oscar looks ready.

Not that one yet.

15, 14, 13.

Angel looks ready.

Angel DeMerritt, get your arm off your chair.

Seven, six, five, four, three, two.

Thumbs down.

Write or track Anderson.

Anderson, what's the problem I need to solve today?

You need to make a tariff to see Nelda help Charlie.

Who can tell me what Anderson said, Carlos,

or what you thought?

And again, hedgehog's name today is Glenn.

This is Glenn.

Everyone say again, hi Glenn.

But the problem is, you don't really

know how you're doing this.

And on page two, right below where

you just wrote the problem, I want you to brainstorm,

what do you think you need to know to solve this problem?

Second stop in jot, what do you think you need to know?

What questions do you have for me?

What do you need to know to solve this problem?

Think about it and try to write at least one question you

have for me in the next minute.

What do you need to know?

Jose has an idea.

Darwin is writing.

Angel's writing.

What do you need to know for me?

What do you think you need to know for me?

You need to know how to think the times.

Nelda, she has a great question for me.

You've got 30 seconds.

If you think you're done early, see if you can come up

with another question.

10 seconds.

Mila≈°ka's got her question.

Antoine's got his question.

See if you can think of one more since you're done early.

Rally, Robin.

Back and forth.

A, then B. A, share your question.

B, share your question.

And if your partner gives you something you didn't think of,

Rally, Robin.

Back and forth.

A, then B. A, share your question.

B, share your question.

If you think you're done early, see if you can think of one more

since you're done early.

If your partner gives you something you didn't think of,

write that down too.

You have one minute.

When I see the paper between you, you leaning in,

that's what respect looks like.

Merit.

Merit Eladis adding to her answer.

Merit Jelmaitis, Merit Frandi.

Jose, did she give you anything you didn't have?

You wrote it down?

Write or track me.

Below the stop and jot, I want you to write a T-chart.

And we're going to write down not the questions you ask me,

but the answers.

If it's important, I need to tell you.

Who has a question for me about what you need to know today?

Track Carlos or write?

The weather.

Good question.

We are building it inside.

You must test inside.

So I'm going to answer Carlos's question.

Test inside on a desk.

Good question.

Make sure you write down the answer to Carlos's question.

Darwin, what do you need to know today?

Do you know you get cards?

How do you know you get cards?

Merit Darwin for being observant.

So I'm going to broaden that question to the materials you

need today.

Here are your materials.

You get 50 index cards plus one foot of tape.

50 index cards and one foot of tape.

You may also use, hands down for just a minute,

you may also use scissors plus ruler, but not in the tower.

So you can use them to build, but Anderson,

can I actually put the scissors and ruler in my tower?

I cannot.

Give me a thumb when you have those written,

and then I'll take the next question.

Ready?

Ready?

Ready?

Ready?

I'll give you 10 more seconds before I take the next question.

What else do you need to know?

Next question.

Frandy, what do you need to know?

Hands down, track Frandy.

Ah, great question.

You have 20 minutes to build.

20 minutes to build.

Angel, what's your question?

Hands down, shining on him.

Well, you're going to have these materials on your desk.

The one other rule that could answer his question, hands down,

is you can't tape tower to desk.

So you can use tape, but Jalen, can I actually

tape the tower to my desk?

Hands down, track Oscar if you're done writing.

Well done, Jalen.

Oh, you're placing Glenn on top of the tower,

and that I can actually put on the left.

Glenn must be on the tower for 10 seconds.

Glenn must be on the tower for 10 seconds.

And Carlos asked a really important question

about the weather.

Guys, I have bad news.

It's really, really windy today.

Antoine, can you lend me your binder, please?

So once we put Glenn on top of the tower,

Glenn must stay there for 10 seconds,

but then there's going to be a little bit of a wind today,

and the tower has to stand up to wind for three seconds.

So I'm going to add that below.

Glenn must be on the tower for 10 seconds.

Tower must stand up to wind.

Tower must stand up to wind.

Give me a thumb when you have those written.

Jose looks ready.

Nileshka looks ready.

You guys are crushing it.

Thumbs down.

There's only one question you did not ask me yet.

Well, actually two.

Two.

Hands down, track one, Louis.

What is Glenn's height and weight so you know it's a tower of wind?

That was one of my questions, which is I won't tell you his weight,

but I will tell you you can hold Glenn, but no tests early.

You can hold Glenn, but if you put him on your tower early,

you will fail the challenge.

So if you ask me, Mr. Can I see Glenn?

I will say, sure thing.

You can hold him.

You can hold him.

It's OK.

He won't bite.

You can hold him and feel how heavy or light he is,

but you cannot put him on the tower early.

There's only one question.

It belongs on the left.

He must be on the tower for 10 seconds.

The tower must stand up to wind.

What do you think the last question you should ask me is?

Hands down, track Jalen if you're done writing.

Well, that I think is over here because he needs to be on the tower.

I can't see Glenn.

He's too far down.

So what question should you be asking?

Hands down, track Antoine.

That is the final question, which the answer is,

your tower must be 15 centimeters tall.

What does CM mean again, Wilbur?

Centimeter.

Your tower has to be how tall, Darwin?

Is correct.

Final question, when you're done writing, track Jose Mateo.

What's up?

I think you're doing it in groups or groups.

Ah, I'm going to put that over here.

Your groups are two or three.

And I have made groups for you.

I will tell you what they are in just a minute.

Now, how much time do you have for this challenge?

How much time do you have?

Carlos?

Exactly.

Let me show you how you will meet success today.

Tracking me once you're done writing.

I see Darwin, Carlos.

Starting at four out of four today.

You must brainstorm before beginning to build.

The next page has brainstorming space.

What does brainstorming mean?

Hands down, tracking Frandi in the middle.

I see Jose Mateo.

Mare, for that good answer.

So if Jose's in a group with Darwin, for example, track me.

They would need to think together and have some ideas

down before they get their materials, which are over here.

Your second point is you need to speak to your team

and help your team respectfully.

Juan Luis, second to Mare.

Hands got to be down.

So for example, if I see Jalen not talk the whole time,

she will not get that point.

Third is respect teammates by speaking respectfully.

I think blank, what do you think?

So for example, if Oscar has a great idea,

he can't just talk.

He needs to say something like,

well, I think we should use the cards this way.

Angel, what do you think?

And make sure that his teammate gets to speak too.

And the last point, you have to share materials.

If I see someone go, no, the index cards are mine

and not actually share any of the materials,

you will lose that fourth point.

For a merit, what is not a criteria for success today?

What's not on this list because you're not graded on it?

Hands down, track Jose Mateo.

If you don't finish, posture check, a lady's merit,

you're not gonna lose and you could still get a four out of

four.

Also, if you fail, if Jose's tower doesn't work,

can he still get a four out of four?

And it is more important to me, track the pride values

that I see you respect your team, track me,

by talking respectfully and sharing materials,

than that I see you succeed, capiche?

Capiche.

You're going to have 20 minutes.

I recommend you do five for brainstorm 15 to build.

I'm going to tell you your groups.

You can pick whose desk you build on.

Group number one is Carlos and Wilbur.

Group number two is Jose, Jose and the ladies.

Group number three is Nilsson, Juan Luis and Jill Midas.

Group number four is Frandy, Jaylin and Anderson.

Group number five is Omeel, Camille and Edgar.

Group number six is Angel, Oscar and Darwin.

You're actually gonna come over and take one of these chairs

to work with them.

And group number seven is Nileshka, Antoine.

Track me, thumb up or down.

Can you get materials right away?

Excellent, thumbs down, track the board.

You have 20 minutes for this challenge.

Whoop, did that wrong.

I did 20 seconds, that is not enough time.

Even for master engineers.

Your 20 minutes begins now.

So you guys only have two, which makes it

even more important you're sharing conversations

and talking with each other.

So I'm gonna tell you what I told them.

You only have two, makes it more important

you both step up to have good conversations.

Okay?

Yes.

Camille, shine merit.

Six feet.

Can I pause you?

One, I'm not a mess.

Two, be careful that everyone speaks.

You can draw or you can write for your brainstorm.

There's power, right?

It's in your life, so it's all.

You own thoughts.

So you're telling me who should you be telling this to?

There are no requirements for width, good question.

Okay?

Oh yeah.

Good questions, because that's not in the materials list,

you can't use your binder.

You can only use the cards, the tape,

and I can use the scissors and the ruler to help,

but they can't be in my tower.

Not in the tower, just to help you make it.

So are you guys drawing or writing your brainstorm?

Okay.

I don't care what it looks like as long as you have some idea

of what you're doing, okay?

Merit.

Okay, so I'm going to ask you a question.

What is your challenge?

Open a log, draw.

So you guys are writing down your ideas?

Good, and you can draw to help you,

or if you'd rather, you can just write a couple of sentences.

And Angel, merit for going back to check the rules

of the challenge, that's a smart idea.

Okay, let's keep going.

That's okay.

Track me, don't worry, I've stopped the clock,

your time is not continuing.

My first group is done.

When you think your brainstorm is done,

and everyone has brainstorm written, hold up your papers.

You will then get the following from me.

Oh, I see a group has their papers up,

put your papers down.

I give them one ruler, Jose de Merit,

you should be tracking me right now,

one ruler, one scissors, they get 50 index cards,

and remember, you only get one foot of tape.

Some people were asking me, mister,

how much is one foot of tape?

It's not a lot, it's only about that much,

so be careful with your design.

When I say go, I am restarting the timer.

Go.

Come here.

Okay, there are your cards.

Wait, you'll might, you'll mighties,

you need your tape too.

There you go, all right, last group,

where's the rest of your group?

They're still working.

There is your index cards, ready?

And, go.

Ladies, Jose, do you guys need extra scissors or rulers?

No.

Now, here's my question, I see you holding materials,

him holding materials, what does she get to do?

Is that okay with you?

All of the scissors.

So, please.

These are all the things we forgot to say,

so be careful.

Merit for the good thinking.

But do you need that much tape to connect those two cards?

It's okay.

Now, the tricky thing is, if this was a real,

if you were a real engineer,

you'd have to be careful with your materials,

because could you go say,

I'm gonna go buy a lot more steel for my bridge?

Nope, that costs a lot.

It costs a lot, so be very careful

with how you use your materials.

Yes, you can.

Oh, you guys dropped some building materials.

So, what is your idea for your design?

So, our idea is to make a form of a,

so we can build up.

I like it.

And if you put that, you put, go like that.

Why are you using triangles?

Because when we start, we want like this,

and then we start to think of the whole triangle

and then we start to think of the whole thing.

How do you think you could make it more stable?

Well, no, I think the triangles are stable,

but is this your only base?

See, that seems interesting to me,

because if we did that,

what do you think the bigger base would do, Nilsen?

Well, what would that do to the top

if the base is stronger?

The top will be stable and it will not fall.

I mean, what do you observe in the tower on your paper?

What does it look like in the base compared to the top?

It has other surrounding, so it doesn't fall.

But where is it bigger?

Use that in your design.

Also, remember to keep checking the height

to make sure it's on track.

Track me.

I'm going to warn you,

your group is not on track for a four out of four.

Why?

I'm still seeing you guys hold cards

and her looking at you.

Make sure every teammate is getting a chance

to hold the cards, okay?

Oh, see, that looks very stable.

That looks interesting.

Why is it so hard?

I don't know.

It's so thick.

I'm gonna put the...

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

Someone record this to your face.

You did it.

You did it.

You did it.

You did it.

You have a choice.

Track me.

I am pausing the clock for exactly two minutes.

You may either use it to continue building

or you may walk around to see what other groups are doing.

If you choose to walk around,

you cannot disrupt them or ask them questions

because they're busy building.

But you may either continue building

or look at the other designs for the next two minutes.

So we've got our base there.

Is he making more triangles?

I like it.

Keep going.

I think that could make it really stable.

Omeel, when you get to five minutes remaining,

use your timers, okay?

Good.

Oh, so I see.

You're going to add up squares.

How tall is each square?

About two and a half centimeters.

I think it's taller than that.

Looks like it's more like seven.

So you don't actually need that many more to get to 15.

My only question is,

why did you choose to put them the short way

instead of the tall way?

Well, could you do it the tall way now?

Because then each one is even taller.

Keep going.

Yes, sir.

Can we touch him?

You may.

Jose, English.

I'm sorry.

Timer is going back on.

Thank you.

Of course.

Remember, would you like to feel the hedgehog?

Would you like to feel the hedgehog?

It's pretty light.

You know he's...

Jose, remember, if you fail the challenge, that's fine.

But be respectful, be calm.

Do you understand?

It's like we talked about on Friday.

What do you do when it gets hard?

So what is our height at?

How close are we to the goal?

13, so you are this close.

Okay, let's do it.

Is your base strong enough to support the top?

Maybe.

I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

Maybe.

You keep doing what you're doing then.

Now, careful, is this stable enough?

How do we make it more stable?

Now, gentlemen, you've got six minutes.

What is our height right now?

Six.

Ooh, this looks interesting.

What is the height of it right now?

Seven, good.

Now, make sure that you're dividing up responsibilities

to get to 15 and 10.

So, one, I'm not Miss.

Two, freeze, track me.

Communicate.

What could she be doing?

Because you need to build more parts

and you could have people building different parts right now.

I asked her if she could help us.

Well, right, but helping isn't helpful

if she doesn't know what you're doing.

You need to communicate better than help me, okay?

Here, this one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

This one.

So, you're making an additional box?

All right, do you like it?

Mm-hmm.

I'm sorry?

Makes sense to me.

Just make sure you're within the time and you reach 15.

Now it looks like everyone's getting involved.

Gentlemen, make sure to keep track of time.

You have five minutes.

Five minute warning.

Five minute warning.

Gentlemen, our tower is currently flat.

We need to make it go up in the next five minutes.

Now, do two boxes get you there,

or do you need to go higher?

No, so it's like above.

Well, let's check it out.

Oh.

Close.

You are so close.

Keep it up.

Do you need to feel Glenn the Hedgehog?

No.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

All right.

It'll go like this.

Now, keep going.

That looks extremely stable.

Does it meet the rules yet?

Does it meet the rules of the challenge yet?

What do you need to do in the next four minutes?

Let's do it.

Oh, but careful.

Can you test early?

Can you test early?

You cannot test early.

So, is it tall enough?

Check page two.

16 what?

Check page two.

See if there are any pieces

that you have forgotten in this challenge.

Yes.

You may, but you cannot test with it early.

Seems to stand up to wind.

I like it.

Now, how are you going to stabilize the walls?

It's okay.

You've got two and a half minutes.

But you said she needs to be on top of it.

She does.

So the interesting thing is,

she does.

So the interesting thing is,

you've got here and here.

How do they fit together?

Yes, sir.

You guys have two parts.

We gotta combine them.

Two minute warning.

So, because you guys tested early,

you must change one thing

because you were not supposed to test early.

30 seconds.

Carlos.

Did we struggle with the challenge?

Yes.

But did you respect each other?

Did you share materials?

Yeah.

You can still earn a four out of 14.

So, it's okay.

Calm down.

Is this stable enough down here?

Hands free.

Track me in five, four, three, two, one.

Track the board.

If you touch your design,

you have failed today's challenge.

Remember, this was the four out of four.

Thumb up or down.

Do you fail today's class if your tower doesn't work?

Hands down.

Track me in five, four, three, two, one.

Track the board.

If you touch your design,

hands down, track Nilsson, shining.

Nilsson, does it say you'll get a zero

if your tower doesn't work?

Track me.

And in fact, which of the pride values

do you see most often on this slide today?

Hands down, track Jose Mateo.

So, track me.

If I can see you shining for other teams,

snapping for them,

you're earning yourself points today.

If I hear anything disrespectful,

you're losing yourself points today.

Capiche?

Capiche.

I'm gonna start over here, move over.

My first group was not able to build a tower,

so shine on them.

Let's see if they can do better next challenge.

21 centimeters tall, hold that please.

Glenn needs to stay on for 10 seconds.

Glenn could not stay on.

Snap for this group.

They met the 15 centimeter requirement.

This group, tracking over here.

It does not.

It is 12 centimeters.

Will Glenn be able to stand?

Glenn cannot stand on top.

Snap it up for this group though, for a very good effort.

This tower is

exactly 15.2 centimeters tall.

Will Glenn stay on?

One, two, three, four, five,

six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

Last requirement, three second gust of wind.

Snap it up for the first group to meet

all three parts of the challenge.

Two claps for them on two.

One, two.

All right.

Moving on to this group.

This group did not meet the height requirement.

It is only eight centimeters tall.

Will Glenn stay on?

One, two, three, four, five,

six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

And it stands up to wind.

Snap it up for this group.

Two out of three.

Final group.

The group, stay serious.

This final group still meets the height requirement.

It is 22 centimeters tall.

Will Glenn stay on?

Glenn will not stay on.

Snap it up for this group for meeting

the height requirement.

Track me, posture check.

Track up there.

Jose Francis, remind me, what word do I see

over and over on that slide?

Track me.

I heard a little giggling, we fixed it.

Groups were respectful, snapping, shining.

Anderson, merit to you.

Congratulations, you've completed

your first engineering challenge.

There will be many more during this unit.
