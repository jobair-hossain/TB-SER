So this is a major theme and it's what makes it what's called a sentimental novel, yeah?

In other words, what is... Tom makes an appearance here. What does he spend his time doing?

Uh, well, like he's very quiet the whole time, like he's not really...

What's he thinking about? What's he thinking about? You're told explicitly...

Yeah, you worry about who's going to take me. And he's purchased by Lecrae, right?

Lecrae walks up to him. What does he say?

Oh, that was our theme. Okay, so like he literally walks up to him and he's like,

where are you from? And he's asking these questions and it makes him take his clothes off and like...

Yep.

Strip some... Like what we said was it was kind of like stripping him of his identity.

So the stripping bit, right? All of that is an effort to destroy him as a respectable human being, right?

And he was dressed like classy, like he had like, pink clothing.

Which is an external sign of what?

Like, probably kind of educational?

Yeah, even more than that, right?

Like, status.

Yes, yes. These are not status-neutral people, right?

Two Harriet Beecher Stowe, right? Your bourgeois, right? Your middle-class affect,

in other words, the clothes you wear, right? You know, the ways that you dress are very much

what makes you moral. There's a huge confusion about that, right? So in the case of Tom's dress,

his careful mementos, right? What's he carrying along with him in his dress?

A Bible.

A Methodist... Book.

Yeah, it's a Bible.

And then he like totally takes it away from him and he's like, I'm your God now.

Yeah.

And his identity's gone.

So no, he's literally like...

He's lost the Bible.

Everything that made him like moral.

He doesn't have the hymn book, but think about what that says to an evangelical Christian.
